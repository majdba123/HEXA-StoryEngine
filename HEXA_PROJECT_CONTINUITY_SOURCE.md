# HEXA PROJECT CONTINUITY SOURCE

## OFFICIAL CURRENT CHECKPOINT

Last updated: 2026-09-19

This file is the operational handoff for the HEXA StoryEngine project. It is authoritative for the current accepted baseline.

### Current accepted baseline

- Baseline name: Montage11 / Bayer baseline
- Functional scope: Pass1 + Pass2 extraction/refinement only
- Layer3 / Pass3: REJECTED and NOT part of the accepted product baseline
- Accepted source commit before this documentation-only checkpoint:
  - `a983ea44a9b295b8d4e7ab6d567f88e79f01ec23`
  - message: `[montage11] Generalize Pass2 separation and strengthen V7 presentation`
- Source tree: `c2f880ba0e0b81fde99329cc34d34b38ec4a92fa`
- At recovery time, branches `majd` and `bayer` were identical at the source commit above.

### CI proof for the accepted source

- `majd` CI run: `35397632207` — SUCCESS
- `bayer` CI run: `35402644424` — SUCCESS
- Workflow: `V2 CI`
- Official GitHub Actions source artifact:
  - `hexa-storyengine-source-a983ea44a9b295b8d4e7ab6d567f88e79f01ec23`
  - artifact id: `10569495135`
  - SHA256: `9421f62d450b33c6e33451be1535bdedd4a1528ea4fc7ec85c460f3390d37512`

### Accepted render reference

- Filename: `HEXA_BAYER_MONTAGE11_BASELINE.mp4`
- SHA256: `67b5733d89ee41d9f45aa2e27c2d8548bd39895900351c9612e8570b0674520b`
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Frame rate: 30 fps
- Duration: 102.4 s
- Video codec: H.264
- Audio codec: AAC

This render is the visual regression reference for current work.

## HARD DECISIONS

1. Do not use any Layer3 / Pass3 implementation, experiment, dataset render, overlay system, host reconstruction experiment, or high-sensitivity third-pass extraction in production.
2. Do not use any post-Montage11 experimental render as a baseline.
3. Pass1 and Pass2 behavior, composition ordering, motion ordering, synchronization, and rendering behavior are protected baseline behavior.
4. New work must begin from the accepted Montage11/Bayer source, not from local experimental snapshots.
5. If a future change alters composition, ordering, timing, alpha extraction, motion, or render behavior, compare against the accepted baseline render before accepting it.
6. Layer3 may only be reopened if the user explicitly requests it again. Until then it is considered permanently out of scope.

## REJECTED EXPERIMENTAL LINE

All Layer3 / Pass3 work performed after the accepted Montage11/Bayer baseline is rejected, including experiments that caused:
- composition reordering,
- elements entering or overlapping each other,
- rectangular clearing/cropping,
- host damage,
- semantic over-segmentation,
- shadow/ghost artifacts,
- unstable family motion.

None of those experimental outputs may be treated as a source of truth.

## CURRENT PROJECT POSITION

We are back on the stable Montage11 architecture:
`Final Package -> Vision -> Pass1 -> Pass2 -> Story -> Composition -> Motion -> Render -> QA`

There is no accepted third extraction layer.

The next engineering work must improve or extend the product without changing this baseline unintentionally. Any extraction improvement should be made inside the existing Pass1/Pass2 architecture or behind an explicit opt-in experiment that cannot affect the accepted baseline.

## BRANCH POLICY FOR THIS CHECKPOINT

After this handoff update, `majd` and `bayer` must point to the same documentation-only checkpoint commit. The application code in that commit must remain identical to source commit `a983ea44a9b295b8d4e7ab6d567f88e79f01ec23`; only this continuity document is added.
